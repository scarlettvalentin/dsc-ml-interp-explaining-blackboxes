    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are often considered to be complex and difficult to interpret due to their highly non-linear nature. However, with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to make neural networks more interpretable. One approach is to use techniques such as visualization of the network's weights, activations, and gradients, which can help to understand the relationships between inputs and outputs. Additionally, there are also interpretable neural network architectures, such as decision trees or rule-based systems, that are designed to be more easily interpretable than traditional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will discuss some of the techniques available to interpret or explain neural networks. Then, we will build a neural network together with scikit-learn and explain the results using the techniques that we learned. You can use this code as a template in the future to create neural networks and output useful reports to explain your results."

It can give you more information about a model's predictions than the simple `predict` method.

    "## Combining Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the inferences that we made so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The attributes selected by researchers to be included in the data have been determined to be relevant in diagnosing malignancy mammograms.\n",
    "2. Since \"worst\" is used to describe the largest cell nuclei in the observed sample, there is some relationship between malignancy and cell nuclei size.\n",
    "3. There are more observations that are malignant.\n",
    "4. The model is \"cautious\" in determining that an observation is __benign__. The model is more likely to mis-classify a negative result as positive. \n",
    "5. In our sample, the model is _mildly_ confident that this observation is malignant, because of the `fractal_dimension_mean`. However, because the observation has values for other features that are typically associated with benign, the confidence of the model is somewhat diminished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the inferences, we might explain that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since the researchers have indicated that \"worst\" pertains to \"largest\", we understand that having larger values in key fields contributes to a malignancy classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The recall is 100%, which means that false positives are more likely than false negatives. However, that could be due to a class imbalance. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. However, we have observed that in a particular sample, that the `fractal_dimension_mean` was a strong contributor to a malignancy classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have created a baseline model and examined the results to craft an explanation, our work is not yet done. Since we have a class imbalance and a recall of 100%, our next iteration might include applying preprocessing techniques to correct for the class imbalance. We might also choose to tune the hyper-parameters of neural network or LIME explainer to improve the model's performance and/or explanations.  "
